## Problem Statement
Typically, high-rise apartments are provided the facility of lift/elevator. The behaviour required is
that a user enters a lift-car and requests the destination floor. The lift shall take the user to the
destination floor. The design should be such that: after a floor is requested the car shall service the
request only if there is a user inside the car and shall have safety inbuilt against (to tackle) free fall.
